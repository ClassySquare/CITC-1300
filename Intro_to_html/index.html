        <h1>Initial D</h1>
        <p>Initial D is an anime/manga series made in the 90's. 
        It involves a young man named Takumi Fujuwara, and he is tasked by his father to deliver tofu down the Akina Mountain pass. 
        The way he does so is with his car: a Panda Toyota Sprinter Trueno. The American equivalent would be a Black/White Toyota Corolla hatchback. 
        Using this vehicle, he develops a legendary driving style that allows him to quickly finish the pass in under 4 minutes. 
        Akina Mountain is full of corkscrew turns and straight-aways that normal drivers take serious precaution on.
        Eventually he gets confronted by local street racers, and is dragged into the world of Drift Racing.</p>
